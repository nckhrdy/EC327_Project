Project Overview: Our project is a secure passwords and sensitive information Android App that allows user to store and retrieve information.

How to Run: 

Build Overview: The project was split into two main aspects. The front end app design and code using  Android Studio, and the back end raspberry pi component. The Raspberry Pi functions as our back end program and is written in Java. The primary focus for us was to create a fully functional and robust backend program that stores and passes information safely upon request.
